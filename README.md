# AgileSync - Seamless C++ Data Center Integration
The project involved the development of a comprehensive data management system using C++ for a data center environment. It comprised six subsystems: File Transfer, Data Extraction, Data Standardization, Data Storage, Data Synchronization, and Data Service Bus. Leveraging C++ and Linux, the system facilitated efficient file transfer, data extraction, and storage, ensuring seamless data standardization and synchronization between MySQL and Oracle databases. Utilizing multithreading, advanced schema mapping, and HTTP access, the system achieved high-performance data processing, fault tolerance, and secure data access. The project demonstrated expertise in C/C++ application development, Linux, network programming, and database management.
